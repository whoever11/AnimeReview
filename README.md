# AnimeReview

## Project Overview

This project is a web application for anime enthusiasts to browse anime titles, view detailed information, read reviews, and submit their reviews. It features a homepage displaying a selection of anime titles with comprehensive information and user-submitted reviews.

## Features

- **Browse Anime**: Users can view a selection of anime titles that have detailed information for each of them with descriptions, characters, ratings, genre. 
- **Reviews**: Users can read reviews left by other users on the anime detail page.
- **Submit Reviews**: Users have the option to submit their reviews for an anime, including a rating and text review.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend API**: ( - e.g., Node.js, Express for REST API)
- **Database**: (my own database - e.g., MongoDB)
- **Other libraries**: Axios for HTTP requests

#Step 1
 making the database through MongoDb focusing on anime, characters and reviews.

 #Step 2
 Putting the database through javascript so the information shows on the front end

 #Step 3 
 Style the design to fit what i would like for the project to look like.

 ##Issues
 -I should have spent alot more time on the front end building it out first before working on the javascript, even just typing the information in the html for it to so one the screen first.
- My focus on the backend of the project was too much to where when things would break on the front end, my process should have slowed down.
##Wins
-I understand through all the console errors, issues with the project the backend really good for pulling the api data
-Understanding my weakness and flaws with front end planning and for future projects doing a dummy website first, making sure everything looks visually how i would like it even after i build out the design in figma to make sure i can meet the front end requirements.
